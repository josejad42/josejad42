What's up guys? My name is Alex, and I'm currently a computer engineering student at UFPE. I am very interested in quantum computing, an area in which I am involved in scientific research. One library I use is Qiskit. Also, I am particularly interested in hardware development and theory of computation.

I explored the fundamentals of programming in C, C++ and Python, improving my understanding of algorithms and data structures. Additionally, I ventured into hardware design with Verilog, gaining insights into assembly language, low-level programming, and system architectures.
